# csha's digital garden

Hello dear stranger,\
and welcome to my *digital garden*. It is a place where I 
collect my *obscure knowledges*, as well as my *in-progress understandings* of 
many a thing. To see this project's source code, visit 
[github](https://github.com/m93a/digital-garden).

This place still is – and always will be – growing! You can check one of the 
many new articles, like [the chsh game](quantum/chsh-game), or... well, that's
all we've got for now. But be sure to come back later!
