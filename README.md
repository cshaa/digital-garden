This is my digital garden, made in SvelteKit and Markdown, and hosted on [garden.csha.io](https://garden.csha.io). All the code under in `src/` is under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/). Please feel encouraged to reuse this system for your own digital garden!

The articles in `static/articles/` are technically my IP, so please cite me properly, but I won't be mad if you reuse large chunks of my texts, or if you republish entire articles in a different medium. Unless you try to present them as your original work, of course.
